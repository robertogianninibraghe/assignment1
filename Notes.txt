README is clear and detailed.

Functions definition outside the class definition would make the code more readable.
The classes shouldn't all be defined in the same header file.

You shouldn't overload the operator() to implement the main method of a class. If you want the minimization to be easily called via () you should implement a template function, otherwise inside a class you should define a method, for instance minimizer2::minimize().

I would have expected you to let the user choose the optimization parameters, the step size for the finite difference approximation and the minimization strategy runtime, using GetPot for instance.
